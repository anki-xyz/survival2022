# survival2022
This is where the stuff goes today.
I have changed here some of the text, which is kind of **cool**

## Some subheadline

This is how I install it:

    https://github.com/anki-xyz/survival2022.git


## How to use this:

    from survival2022.plot import noOutline
    noOutline()

## How I got h5py to work

    pip uninstall tables

    conda install -c conda-forge pytables

Then it worked like a charm!
